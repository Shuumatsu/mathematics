Axiom 3.1 (Sets are objects). If A is a set, then A is also an object. In particular, given two sets A and B, it is meaningful to ask whether A is also an element of B.


Definition 3.1.4 (Equality of sets). Two sets A and B are equal, A = B, iff every element of A is an element of B and vice versa. To put it another way, A = B if and only if every element x of A belongs also to B, and every element y of B belongs also to A.
So there's only one empty set ∅.

Axiom 3.2 (Empty set). There exists a set ∅, known as the empty set,
which contains no elements, i.e., for every object x we have x ̸∈ ∅.


Lemma 3.1.6 (Single choice). Let A be a non-empty set. Then there exists an object x such that x ∈ A.

and we use cardinality to describe the counts of the elements in a set.


union operation is commutative

subset and proper subset

Sets are partially ordered by set inclusion(the natural numbers are totally ordered)
